			<h1 class="title">About</h1>
			<p>
				This website serves as a repository of the many bad musical performances that have been collated over a
				decade of Christmas music collections, and also a select few less bad ones.
				<br>
				<br>
				The website was a collaboration between Matthew and Allie. Allie—although rather less conspicuous on the
				site—did about as much of the website making (designing, coding, debugging, etc) as Matthew did of the
				performing: not quite all but the large majority by a long way.
			</p>
			<h2 class="subtitle">How to use the site</h2>
			<p>
				The site is designed to hopefully be fairly straightforward to use: the main
				<a href="/index.html">homepage</a> shows a video at the top, and allows you to browse other videos
				below. The slider allows you to filter by year (personally I reckon it all started going downhill after
				about 2012…). The tags let you sort to only performances of a certain category ('Best of' has been
				curated for those who don't actually want to watch all 133 videos). The instruments can also be filtered
				in the same way (I personally recommend the euphonium back-catalogue), as can the performers. Also on
				the site are this page, and the <a href="/history.html">History</a> page, which gives a brief history of
				the decade-long musical endeavour.
				<br><br>
				If you habitually listen to music on/through YouTube (eg through a TV or smart speaker) and would find
				that easier than watching through the website, I have made a <a
					href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKUsbgq2XqTjQ9EDGChdbZE7MPTTaGycC">YouTube playlist</a>
				with all the videos on this site – you can use this to listen to the recordings however you usually use
				YouTube (on a desktop computer, phone, tablet, TV, etc). It <i>should</i> contain all the videos, but it
				is entirely possible that some have been missed!
				<br><br>
				As may have become apparent by this point, this site is a work in progress, so things may change over
				the course of time (or we may get distracted by other things in life and never finish adding the
				content/features we originally intended to). And if something doesn't work, let us know!
