			<h2 class="subtitle">
				In the decade since its inception, the annual Christmas collection of music gifted by Matthew (with
				occasional input from Allie) has amassed hours of videos, spread across more than a hundred different
				performances. Below is a brief précis of the long and storied history of the many volumes collated on
				this website.

			<h1 class="title">2009</h1 class="title">
			<div class="columns">
				<p class="column is-10">
					The Law Collection™ story begins in 2009. An eleven-year-old Matthew had been playing piano
					for
					three years, following in the footsteps (fingersteps?) of Great Grandad Reg. Also following Grandad
					Reg
					was nine-year-old Allie (the Artist Formerly Known As James) who, as Reg had done, was
					learning
					the clarinet. I (Matthew) had been learning on the piano passed down from Grandad Reg (as I
					continued to
					do for a decade to come), and in 2009 we found some floppy disks(!) with old recordings of Grandad
					playing. By playing these through the piano and then externally recording the piano's output to a
					laptop, we were able to produce a CD of (previously unheard!) recordings of his playing for the
					family.
					While looking through these recordings, we also noticed a few that I had recorded a couple of years
					earlier, including some Grade 1 pieces (like <a
						href="https://lawcollection.co.uk/?v=xK_7l8yB_yA">Banges Herzelein</a> and <a
						href="https://lawcollection.co.uk/?v=9bS0DDLvhBw">Allegro</a>). Somewhere along
					the
					line, the idea was had that we could produce a DVD containing these recordings, in addition to new
					video
					recordings of the best piano and/or clarinet performances we could muster. Thus was born the Law
					Collection, or as it was at the time, "The Best of M & J Vol.1".

					By 2010 any previous sibling co-operation or co-production had gone, and "The Best of M & J" became
					"The
					Matthew Law Music Collection". A gap in the school's Junior Orchestra led my music teacher to
					suggest
					that I start learning the euphonium (it's like a tuba but smaller), which I enthusiastically did in
					September 2010, just in time to give everyone a taste of what a painful-sounding idea it was at
					Christmas.

					By 2011 the now-annual DVD had morphed into an activity by which—lacking any immediate schoolwork
					deadlines—I could spend the entire week manifesting my potent mix of perfectionism and
					last-minute-ism,
					resulting on an ever increasing amount of time being spent designing the DVD's cover and an ever
					diminishing amount of time being spent polishing the pieces, whose quality was questionable at best.

					The DVD's cover (inexplicably labelled '2012') is a take-off of that of <a
						onclick="modal('scott')">one
						of my piano books at the time</a>, a reference which I spent far too much time finding the
					perfect
					fonts for given that I doubt anyone else got it.

					The only copy of the cover of 2012's DVD I can find is that posted by Auntie Karen to Facebook,
					since (perhaps in the interest of my trademark last-minute-ism) the cover
					was designed by hand and then photocopied. This hand-drawn/handwritten aesthetic was matched in the
					videos, which were titled with a font made from my handwriting.
					For the first time, some of the performances were on a piano other than that bequeathed by Grandad
					Reg:
					one December afternoon I went into the school where Dad attempts to teach, and used their Very Nice
					and
					Very Expensive grand piano.
					2012 marked the year I moved on from my first piano teacher (who was actually a violinist and so had
					come to the conclusion that by that point she had taught me all she knew about playing the piano),
					to my
					second, a music teacher at Dad's school. By my calculations, it was also around this time that I
					first
					played at church (or maybe summer youth camp?), since 2012 sees the first appearance of Christian
					worship songs on the DVDs.

					The cover of 2013's DVD (by this point "The Fifth Annual Matthew Law Music Collection") was
					minimalistic
					because my chronic last-minute-ism meant that it had no choice but to be. On the back, a poem (a
					pastiche of one found in a beloved Christmas children's book since lost to a second hand store)
					acknowledges the unremitting last-minute-ness of the production, the description of overnight DVD
					production not being an exaggeration.

					As can be seen in the <a href="http://lawcollection.co.uk/?v=ZO5zcAb-Y1g">"Making Of" video</a> ,
					2014's edition of
					the DVD was filmed almost immediately before I performed in the Church's nativity service: as
					opportunistic and content-hungry as ever, I swiftly co-opted them to be included in the DVD. The
					Making
					Of also documents the now-normal practice of staying awake all night in order to complete the DVD,
					the
					logical ultimate conclusion of the ever-present last-minute-ism. I'd like to say that I have
					reformed my
					childish ways and seen the light of perfectly planned present production, but as I write this it is
					currently 3am on Christmas Eve… 🙃

					The year started out well – I was doing well at sixth form, where I had good friends and a French
					exchange student who introduced me to some cool French synthpop, but at some point it turned out
					that
					applying the same last-minute all-nighter workflow to each piece of work I had was not the best
					recipe
					for productivity, nor for that matter for avoiding going "a bit mad".
					Given the stresses of the year, I opted to—for the first time since 2008—not produce a DVD, but a
					couple
					of days before Christmas the pull of Christmas tradition became irresistible and I ended up
					recording
					whatever I could muster and uploading them straight from my phone to YouTube in time for a link to
					the
					playlist in cards (or maybe some tasteful origami) on Christmas day. Having stopped piano lessons
					(and
					indeed for a period pretty much everything else in life), the formally-taught <a
						href="http://lawcollection.co.uk/?v=4oPnFsYPNX8">Allegros</a>
					, <a href="http://lawcollection.co.uk/?v=Vu6QF3Hg__A">Allegrettos</a>

					and <a href="http://lawcollection.co.uk/?v=vS0k8xJKB0E">Allegrissimos</a> of previous years were

					I haven't dwelled on it above (I figured it might get a bit repetitive), but throughout my
					aforementioned long and illustrious piano-playing career, I had been steadily working my way through
					the
					graded exams, which culminate in Grade Eight (which Uncle Simon had never reached when he was
					learning
					piano as a boy…). In 2016, having returned from the hiatus from formal piano lessons, I successfully
					reached that level, qualifying me as *checks notes* the World's Best Piano Player. Unlike in
					previous
					years, when everyone had known about the exam beforehand, I had intentionally kept the Grade Eight
					under
					wraps from grandparents, aunt, uncles, and all other members of the vast Matthew Law fanbase (most
					of
					whom I assume were secretly hoping dreading the hiatus would be permanent). The certificate on the
					back
					wasn't just boasting, then – it was the means through which extended family and assorted
					well-wishers
					were informed of my certified piano prowess.

					In December 2017 I had just spent my first term at university in Nottingham, living away from home
					for
					the first time – and much more importantly, away from a piano! Despite this dire living situation, I
					still managed to piece together what was to be the final physical DVD out of what I had learnt
					before
					heading off to uni, practised on a plasticky half-length keyboard awkwardly perched on my desk and
					plugged into GarageBand (until the next February when I got a full sized piano keyboard all of my
					own!).
					The DVD's cover was a digital collage of dozens of images of me, friends, family, and a few slightly
					random pop culture references, and was inspired by <a onclick="modal('sufjan')">that of Sufjan
						Steven's All Delighted People

					Following many comments from certain family members about how no one actually appreciates twenty
					badly
					sight-read pieces (compounded by a combination of my own perfectionism and innate last-minute-ism),
					I
					decided to follow an ethos of quality over quantity. What this meant in practice was that my
					shortlist of
					twenty candidate songs was quickly whittled down to one that fulfilled the criteria of a) being
					previously
					unheard (performed by me, at least) and b) reaching my newly elevated quality standard. Suffice to

				Which brings us to now, the Year of Our Lord 2019 anno domini (specifically, 4:03 am on Christmas Eve).
				In a
				U-turn from last year, this year I decided to again prioritise quantity over quality, resurrecting many
				of
				the pieces last year deemed not nearly good enough. Oh, how the mighty have fallen. The only slightly
				redeeming factor is that I managed to record on the same Very Nice and Very Expensive grand piano I did
				seven years ago, and so fragments of songs that have been stuck in my head and sound kinda awful when
				played
				on the electric keyboard do sound positively virtuosic (…at least they do in my head). To find out more
				about the production of the site itself, go to <a href="/about.html">the about page</a>.
